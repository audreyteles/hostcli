# hostcli

### How it works

- [Download](https://github.com/audreyteles/hostcli/releases/tag/0.1.0) the program file.

- Adjust the file permissions to make it executable:
   ```shell
    chmod +x hostcli
    ```

  
- Then, in the same folder, run the following command:
    
   
    ```shell
    sudo ./hostcli
    ```

- (Optional) If you want, you can add an alias to your shell (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
  ```
  alias hostcli='sudo /your/path/to/hostcli'
  ```
  Close and open the shell to apply these changes and you'll be able to call `hostcli` from anywhere.
