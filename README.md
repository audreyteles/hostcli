# hostcli

### How it works

- [Download](https://github.com/audreyteles/hostcli/releases/tag/0.1.0) the program file.

- Adjust the file permissions to make it executable:
   ```shell
    chmod +x hostcli
    ```

  
- Then, in the same folder, run the following command:
    
   
    ```shell
    sudo ./hostcli
    ```
